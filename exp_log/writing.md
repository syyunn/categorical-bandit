1. explain adv/disadv of delegation arm 

2. Current shortage is that I can't model that interest of lobbying firm is not clearly overlapping with that of firms

Main Claim

[Specialization of Lobbying Firms]
Topic-wise + Across Legislators are the most plausible way of inducing the specialization in this simulation.

If the simulation is valid, we can say that lobbying-firms are specialization over topcis, therefore, to do so, they need to specialize over all other topcis so that they can understand all legilators' understandings over the topic.

- Then what is the another type of specialization? 
    - Think about lobbyists are only specialize over some number of legislators.
    - Legistor-specific + Across topic specilization (I argue that this is wrong)
