		\begin{itemize}
			\item What is lobbying?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What do lobbyists do?
				\item Buying vote? 
				\item Infleunce policy or legislators?
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Answer this question by
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Finding the sufficient condition that makes lobbying industry. 
				\item Search for the cause that makes the clients to hire lobbyists.
				\item By simulation experiment.				
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}{What is lobbying?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Yun and Preston (2022) define lobbying as \textbf{delegated information acquisition} process.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Interest groups in lobbying industry hires lobbyists to acquire information about the policy and legislators.
				\item Lobbyists are the agents that acquire information about the policy and legislators on behalf of their clients.		
			\end{itemize}
			\item What kind of information are they acquiring?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Information that can be used to maximize the political economic goal of the interest groups.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}{How to Acquire Information?}
		\begin{itemize}{
			\item By \textbf{interaction} with legislators.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Campaign contribution
					\item Meeting with congressional staffers, etc.
				\end{itemize}
			\item How to model this interaction?
				 \begin{itemize}
					\item By using Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem.
				\end{itemize}}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{What is Multi-Armed Bandit\footnote{Bandit is pejorative name for slot machine because it empties players' pocket} (MAB) problem?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Formulate the exploration-exploitation dilemma problem.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Formulate the \textbf{exploration-exploitation} dilemma problem.
				\item Assume that there are $K$ possible choices (called ``arms'') for the agent to make. 
				\item Each arm has a reward probability $P_k$ that is unknown to the agent.
				\item Whenever the agent chooses an arm, it receives a reward $r_k$ with probability $P_k$.
				\item The agent choose one of the arms for $T$ times and tries to maximize the total reward.
				\item As the agent sequentially choose the arms, the agent builds his own estimate of the reward probability $P_k$ of each arm.
				\item In this scenario, the agent keep facing the \textbf{exploration-exploitation} dilemma whether to choose the best rewarding arm based on his current estimates (so called ``exploitation'') or to try another arm to improve the current estimates because the current estimates can be biased (so called ``exploration'').
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{MAB Problem of Interest Groups}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Interest groups face the Multi-Armed Bandit problem when they participate information acquisition process in legislative space.
			\item There are $K$ number of legislators that interest groups can interact with. 
			\item Each legislator has a reward probability $P_k$ that is unknown to interest groups.
			\item Interest groups has a limited budget and time constraint to interact with legislators. (Model it as $T$ times of interaction)
			\item How to balance between exploration and exploitation to find the best fit legislator within this limited chances of interactions? (MAB problem)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Formulation of MAB Problem of Interest Groups} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There exists $C \in \mathbb{N}$ number of categories of interest.
			\item Assume there are $j \in J$ number of interest groups with $\phi(j): J \rightarrow C$ which represents unique category of interest $\phi(j)$ for each interest group.
			\item There are $K$ number of legislators with $P_k$ reward distribution.
			\item $P_k$ is modeled as a \textbf{Categorical distribution} with $C$ number of categories. $P_k$ is parameterized by $\mathbf{p_k} = [p_k^{(1)}, p_k^{(2)}, \hdots, p_k^{(C)}]$ where $p_k^{(i)} \in [0,1], \sum{p_k^{(i)}}=1$ with the support of $x_k \in \{1,2,\hdots,C\}$.  
			% (In other words, $X_k \sim \operatorname{Categorical}(\mathbf{p_k})$ where $X_k$ represents the category of authority of the $k$th legislator.)
			(In other words, )
			\item Whenever an interest group $j$ interact with a legislator $k$, they receive $c \in \{1, 2, \hdots, C\}$ sampled from $P_k$.
			\item  Each interst group $j$ gets reward of $r_j^{kn} = \mathbbm{1}(x_j^{kn} = \phi(j))$ when $j$ choose legislator $k$ at time $t$ and sampled $x_j^{kn}$ from $P_k$. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In other words, interest group $j$ with $\phi(j) = c$ gets reward of $1$ when they sample $c$ from interaction with legislator $k$.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{How to solve MAB problem?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use \textbf{Thompson Sampling} algorithm.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Each interest group $j$ has their own prior belief over $\mathbf{p_k}$.
				\item Keep updating this prior belief over $\mathbf{p_k}$ using the sampled observations from the interaction with legislators.
				\item The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $f(\mathbf{p_k} | \mathcal{O}) \propto \mathcal{L(\mathcal{O | \mathbf{p_k}})} f(\mathbf{p_k})$ where $\mathbf{p_k} \sim \operatorname{Dirichlet(\mathbf{D_k})}$ with $\mathbf{D_k} = [d_k^{(1)}, d_k^{(2)}, \hdots, d_k^{(C)}] \in \mathbb{R}^C $ and $\mathcal{O}$ represents sampled observations from the interaction with legislators, i.e. $\mathcal{O} = [x_{j, t=1}^{k_1}, x_{j, t=2}^{k_2}, x_{j, t=3}^{k_3}, \hdots]$ where $x_{j, t}^{kt}$ is an observation sampled from the interaction with the legislator $k$ at time $t$. 
					\item This is a $C$ dimensional generalization of the Beta conjugate with Bernoulli likelihood.
					\item As we did in Beta conjugate, we can update the prior belief by simply adding $1$ to $d_c$ when observe $x_j = c \in C$ at each step $t \in T$.
					\item In this way of Bayesian update, interest groups can systematically update their prior belief over $\mathbf{p_k}$ based on obsevations from interactions with legislators.
				\end{itemize}
				\item After update, choose the best rewarding legislator $k$ based on the samples from posterior distributions $\{f(\mathbf{p_k} | \mathcal{O})| k \in \{1, 2, \hdots, C\}\}$ for the next legislator to interact with.
				%  Intuitively, the posterior distribution is the internal beleif of the interest group over the categorical distribution of legislator $k$
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Validate Thompson Sampling Algorithm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Let's check whether the Thompson Sampling algorithm can actually find the best rewarding legislator within the limited number of interactions.
			% \item 32 legislators with 4 categories of interest. T=2000. (Total $32 \times 4 = 128$ number of parameters to search)
			\item We use the metric called \textbf{Regret} to measure the performance of the algorithm for MAB problem. 
			\item $\operatorname{Regret}_t^j \triangleq p_c^*-p_{a_t}^j$ where $c = \phi(j)$ and $p_c^* = \operatorname{argmax}_{k \in K}\{p_1^{(c)}, p_2^{(c)}, \hdots, p_K^{(c)}\} $ and $p_{a_t}^j$ is the $c$th parameter of $P_k$ when the agent choose the legislator $k$ at time $t$. $a_t$ represent the action (choice of legislator) taken by the agent at time $t$.
			\item \item Regret represents how much the agent could have been done better in terms of the reward if it had chosen the best action.
			\item Similarly, $\operatorname{Cumulative \text{ } Regret}_t^c \triangleq \sum_t^T p_c^*-p_{a_t}^j$.
			\item Agent tries to minimize the cumulative regret for the entire time horizon $T$.

			\item $K=11$ is the best rewarding legislator for category $c$.

			\item The agent failed to find the best rewarding legislator $K=68$ and exploited the worse rewarding legislator $K=90$ mostly.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{How to Explore a Large Search Space?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item From the previous two simulations, we've seen that interest groups fail to find the best rewarding legislator in a large search space.
			\item If we accept the setting that the MAB with large search space plausibly model the exploration-exploitation dillema that the real world interest groups face, how do they solve this large search space problem?
			\item \textbf{Conejcture: }
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Interest groups use lobbyists to successfully explore the large search space. 
				\item A lobbyist has multiple interest groups as their clients so they can explore more legislators than a single interest group since the resources are concentrated from multiple clients.
				% \item For this concentration to happen, the lobbyists need to have better understanding of the legislators' reward distribution for the common categories of interest of their clients.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Hypothesis: }
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Interest groups can successfully explore the large search space by concentrating their resources to their hired lobbyist to delegate the exploration of legislative psace.
			% \item Ratio of interest groups using lobbyists increase as the prior knowledge of the lobbyists over the legislators' reward distribution increases.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{How to Introduce Lobbyist into MAB formulation?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Introduce new $l \in L$ arms which represent lobbyists.
			\item Each lobbyist arm $l$ has a set of parameters of Dirichlet distribution for each legislator $\{D_k^l | k \in 1, 2, \hdots, K \}$ as same as any other interset groups.
			\item Allow any interest groups to choose any lobbyists at each step. 
			\item If an interset group choose to use a lobbyist, the interest group determine with which legislator to interact based on the current posterior distributions of the lobbyist.
			\item After getting observation from the chosen legislator, the interest group update the parameter of the lobbyist's parameter of Dirichlet distribution, not its own.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Pros:} Interest group can take advantage of the lobbyist's knowledge of the legislators' reward distribution. This distribution could be less biased because many interest groups can collectively update the lobbyist's parameters.
					\item \textbf{Cons:} Interest group can not update its own distribution. This means that the interest group can not learn from its own experience.
				\end{itemize}
