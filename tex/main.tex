What is lobbying? This paper provides an answer to this question by modeling the lobbying industry with a multi-agent multi-armed (MAMA) bandit problem.
In this MAMA bandit problem, bandits (which represents clients who hire lobbying firms) interact with arms (which represents legislators) to explore the unknown payoff of each legislator (arm) to maximize their rewards.



% This paper shows that the lobbyists are born among the agents if we allow agents to delegate their exploration to other agents.
% By showing that some agents voluntarily become lobbyists while maximizing their rewards, this paper provides a simulation-based proof that lobbying is a delegated information acquisition process.

\section{Introduction}
% \begin{center}

% \end{center}
What is lobbying in the United States? This simple question has been asked for a long time, but there is no clear answer with agreement among scholars.
For example, \textit{vote-buying} theories argue that lobbying is to buy votes in legislation \citep{grossman}, however, the theory doesn't explain why the average price of vote is too cheap compared to the expected return from lobbying.
Besides, \textit{persuasion} theories argue that lobbying is to persuade legislators to change their positions on legislation \citep{truman, Bauer2017, milbrath1984washington}, however, this theory couldn't explain the empirical findings that people often lobby already like-minded legislators those who don't need any more persuasions.

% Final example is \textit{informational} theories which argues that lobbying is to provide detailed information about specific issue areas to legislators \citep{hall_deardorff_2006}.
% However, this paper focuses on the whole new perspective of lobbying, which argues that lobbying is a delegated information acquisition process \citep{rif}. According to this perspective,
% lobbying is to acquire information about legislative space. 

This paper, above all other theories, aims to simulatively prove \textit{Reverse Information Theory on Lobbying (RIF)} \citep{rif} which explains lobbying as a \textit{delegated information acquisition process}.
According to RIF, every legislator has a different level of authority over different issue areas but clients lack an understanding of which legislator has which authority over which issue areas.
Therefore, they hire lobbyists (or lobbying firms) to acquire information related to their business.
For example, Waymo LLC., an autonomous vehicle company reported they hired a lobbying firm, Holland \& Knight LLP., to acquire information on Build Back Better Act provisions on autonomous vehicles\footnote{\url{https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/0fe5096c-adc4-486a-93fe-7d8b99b823b5/print/}}. 
To Waymo, keep tracking the development of Build Back Better Act will be costly and lack an expertise on analyzing complicated legal articles and politics behind it. Therefore, they hire highly specialized lobbying firm who has its own expertise on policy development on the issue area of autonomous vehicle. The lobbying firm Holland \& Knight also has NAVYA Inc., a self-driving solutions company as its client, along with General Motors (GM) and Toyota. Seeing this, we can infer that Holland \& Knight has a specialized knowledge on legislative space on automobile industry and companies hire them as their lobbying firm to delegate their information acquisition process.

% Acquisition of information on legislative space requires frequent interaction with legislators and this interaction is costly.
RIF \citep{rif} argues that a group of clients who share the similar interests has an incentive to delegate their information acquisition process to a certain lobbying firm which has expertise on their issue areas of interest.
To support this perspective, this paper models the lobbying industry as a multi-agent multi-armed (MAMA) bandit problem. 
The main reason of modeling the lobbying industry as a MAMA bandit problem is that the lobbying industry is a network of agents (clients) and arms (legislators) and the agents interact with legislators to maximize their rewards.
This fits to how the MAMA bandit problem is formulated.

To model the U.S. lobbying industry as MAMA bandit problem, I model legislators as arms and companies as agents. 
This is an abstraction of U.S. lobbying industry where the companies explore the best rewarding legislators related to their business. However, they don't know which legislators give the best reward to them \textit{a priori}.
Rather, they need to deterimine how strategically explore and interact with which legislator to maximize their rewards.

In addition, this paper models the rewards distribution of arms as categorical distribution to incorporate varying level of authorities of legislators over different issue areas.
For example, Sen. Gary Peters may have a higher level of authority on issues related self-driving cars compared to the issue area of aviation because he's a chair of Senate sub-committee on \textit{surface transportation}.
Therefore, we can expect Waymo will acquire more reward from interacting with Gary Peters compared to interacting with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema who's a chair of Senate sub-committee on aviation.
To model this varying authorities over different issue areas, this paper assumes each agent has its own predefined categories of interest and gets the highest reward when it matches with the legislator's distribution of authority. 
% This agent-specific categorical distribution represents the agent's unique preference over different issue areas.

This paper conjectures incentive of hiring lobbying firm increases as the size of the exploration space increases.
For example, if there exists a large number of legislators, companies will be more incentivized to hire lobbying firms to delegate their exploration due to the limited budget to explore all the legislative space.
Unlike companies, lobbying firms have a large group of clients who share the similar interests who pay them to explore the legislative space.
Therefore, they can specialize in the exploration of certain issue-oriented legislative space and acquire more information related to those issue areas.

% Similarly, if there's a large number of categories for the reward distribution of legislators, companies will be more incentivized to hire lobbying firms to lower the cost of exploration. 
To prove this conjecture simulatively, this paper incorporates a special multi-agents setting which allows agents to delegate their exploration to lobbying firms. In detail, after every round of playing with arms, 
agents can choose to delegate their exploration to other agents who have already explored the better reward to them. 
To enable this, 
% this paper adopts a contextual bandit where every agent gets the context of how much reward other agents get from interacting with which arms. Then by using this context, agents can decide whether to delegate their exploration to other agents for next round.
% If the agent decides to delegate its exploration, it will get the reward following the action of the agent to whom it delegates its exploration.
this paper provides a special arm to each agent on every round. Except the initial round, all agents get provided with the best rewarding arm to them from the pool of learned arms' distribution of all agents. 
This arm represents "delegation" and agents who chose that delegating arm will get the reward following the action of the agent who is the master of that arm. However, since this delegation always give the benefit to agents,
the reward from this special arm will be discounted with proper hyperparameter. Then total sum of discounted rewards will be conferred to the delegated agents. This resembles the situation where the lobbying firm is the master of the delegation arm and the client is the agent who delegates its exploration to the lobbying firm. Then the discount factor represents the cost of hiring the lobbying firm. 
% and the lobbying firm collects its fee from all clients respectively.

% This arm is a categorical distribution which is the same as the agent's own categorical distribution.


In summary, this paper models the U.S. lobbying industry with categorized bandit problem where agents can delegate their exploration to other agent. By doing so, 
this paper expects to simulatively prove that more number of agents tend to choose delegation as the number of legislators and the number of categories increase, which corresponds to the situation where agents have more large space to explore. 





% Since Multi-armed bandit describes an \textit{exploitation} and \textit{exploration} trade-off in sequential decision making. Multi-armed bandit is a metaphor of a reward-seeking agent
% who has multiple choices of actions (arms) and each action has a different payoff. This paper models the perspective in \cite{rif} as the multi-agents multi-armed (MAMA) bandit problem, where clients in the lobbying industry are agents who interact with legislators (arms) to acquire information about legislative space.
% By allowing those agents to delegate their future exploration to other agents, this paper expects to observe the emergence of lobbyists where the system converges to the stable existence of delegation.


\section{Multi-Agent Multi-Armed (MAMA) Bandit Problem}
% This section first explains the vanilla multi-armed bandit problem. After that, this section extends the vanilla multi-armed bandit problem to the multi-agent multi-armed (MAMA) bandit problem. By explaining the rationale behind each step of extension,
This section aims to show that MAMA bandit problem can plausibly represents the U.S. lobbying industry with interactions between companies, legislators and lobbying firms with some institutional features that can explain the lobbying as a delegated information acquisition process.

\subsection{Vanilla Multi-Armed Bandit Problem} \label{vanilla}
Vanilla multi-armed bandit problem is assuming a single agent playing with $K$ number of arms and the reward of each arm $X_{k\in [K]}$ is modeled as a Bernoulli distribution $X_k \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(\theta_k)$.
If we assume that the agent played $k$th arm $n$ times, sum of rewards $Y_k=\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_k \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n, \theta_k)$ because the sum of Bernoulli random variables is Binomial.
Then our goal is to infer $p(\theta_k|y_k)$ which represents the posterior distribution of $\theta_k$ given the observed rewards $y_k$. Intuitively, this represents the learned experience of the agent about the payoff of $k$th arm.
Most widely used method to find the posterior distribution $p(\theta_k|y_k)$ is \textit{Thomposon sampling} \citep{tom}, that uses the $\mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ distribution as the prior which is conjugate for the Binomial likelihood $p(y|\theta_k)$. Formally speaking,
\begin{align*}
p(\theta_k \mid y_k) & \propto p(y \mid \theta) p(\theta) =\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
y
\end{array}\right) \theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y} \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} \theta_k^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta_k)^{\beta-1} \\
& \propto \theta_k^{y_k+\alpha-1}(1-\theta_k)^{n-y_k+\beta-1} \\
& \propto \operatorname{Beta}(y_k+\alpha, n-y_k+\beta) \\
& \propto \operatorname{Beta}(\text{number of success}+\alpha, \text{number of failure}+\beta) && (1)\\
\end{align*}
$(1)$ implies that by adding $1$ to the $\alpha$ when we get a reward from $\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\theta_k)$ and otherwise by adding $1$ to $\beta$,
we can update the posterior distribution $p(\theta_k \mid y_k)$.
\subsection{Adopting Categorized Bandit}
\ref{vanilla} models the payoff of each arm as Bernoulli distribution. However, this paper models the payoff of each arm as categorical distribution.
This is to represent each legislator's varying level of authority over different issue areas. 
% For example, senator Joe Manchin has a high authority
% over the issue area of energy and natural resources because he is the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
% In comparison, senator Ron Wyden has a higher authority over the issue area of tax policy because he is the chair of the Senate Finance Committee.
To model this varying level of authority over different issue areas, this paper models the payoff of each arm as categorical distribution. This scenario is recognized under the name of \textit{categorized bandit} and 
\cite{catego} generalizes \textit{Thomposon sampling} \citep{tom} and introduces \textit{Murphy Sampling} to solve the categorical bandit problem. However, this solution doesn't consider the case of each agent having ordered preference over different categories.
In the lobbying industry, it's common that clients have ordered preference over different issue areas. Therefore, the reward should be maximized when the ordered preference of each agent aligns with the categorical distribution of the legislator.
% For example, \textit{Hyundai Motors, Co.}, a South Korea automobile manufacturer, was recently excluded from the U.S. government's environmental subsidy program for electric cars.
% Since this exclusion is included in \textit{Inflation Reduction Act of 2022} and the bill was introduced by Rep. John Yarmuth, \textit{Hyundai Motors, Co.} has a huge incentive to interact with Rep. John Yarmuth to acquire information about the bill.
In this context, \cite{NEURIPS2019_83462e22} introduces a new algorithm called \textit{CatSE}\label{cat} to solve the categorized bandit problem under the assumption of ordered preference of each agent. Therefore, this paper will use this algorithm to solve the categorized bandit problem.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Multi-Armed (MAMA) Bandit Problem}
% Since this paper aims to plausibly abstractize U.S. lobbying industry and observe the emergence of lobbyists by simulation, this paper allows the delegation of exploration to other agents. 
% Now let's think about multiple bandit agents that can successfully update their posterior distribution by interacting with arms.

Simply creating multiple agents doesn't make it a meaningful multi-agent problem because the agents are not interacting with each other.
To plausibly abstractize the U.S. lobbying industry, this paper assumes a special institutional structure where agents can delegate their exploration to other agents.
To implment this, this paper provides a special arm to each agent on every round. Except the initial round, all agents get provided with the best rewarding arm to them from the pool of learned arms' distribution of all agents. 
This arm represents "delegation" and agents who chose that delegating arm will get the reward following the action of the agent who is the master of that arm. However, since this delegation always give the benefit to agents,
the reward from this special arm will be discounted with proper hyperparameter. Then total sum of discounted rewards will be conferred to the delegated agents. This resembles the situation where the lobbying firm is the master of the delegation arm and the client is the agent who delegates its exploration to the lobbying firm. Then the discount factor represents the cost of hiring the lobbying firm.

This paper expects that agents who have more biased preference over specific category will be eventually be the master of the delegation arm. This is because the agents who have more biased preference over specific category will be more likely to choose the arm that has the highest reward for them. 
This represents the U.S. lobbying industry where the lobbyists are specialized in specific issue areas and the clients delegate their exploration to those specialized lobbyists.


% Therefore, this paper expects that the agents who have more biased preference over specific category will be eventually be the master of the delegation arm. This is because the agents who have more biased preference over specific category will be more likely to choose the arm that has the highest reward for them.

% show the emergence of lobbyists in a purely theoretical and simulated environment where no empirical data is involved. In other words,
% This paper designs the MAMA bandit scenario that is plausibly similar to the real world lobbying industry. In addition, this paper is motivated by \cite{rif} which argues that lobbying is
% to delegate information acquisition processes to lobbyists.
% I suspect the incentive of delegation emerges from the initial asymmetry of information between agents.
% In detail, at the initial stage, let's suppose an agent $A$ who interacted with a legislator who doesn't have a proper authority over the issue area where the agent $A$ is interested.
% However, at the same time, there could be another agent $B$ who interacts with a legislator who has a proper authority over the issue area where the agent $A$ is interested.
% Therefore, if we allow the agents to \textit{trade} their information, the agent $A$ can acquire the information about the issue area that he's interested in.
% For example, \cite{mama} simulatively shows that the agents acquire higher total rewards if they're allowed to trade their information in MAMA situations.
% In addition, if we allow agents to \textit{delegate} exploration, all agents are expected to score higher total rewards (pareto improvement). This is because a group of agents who share the same issue area of interest can explore more efficiently without duplicated interactions with poorly rewarding legislators when exploration is delegated to specific agents.
% Therefore, this paper aims to find the set of institutional features that can lead to the emergence of lobbyists in a simulative environment.
% Initial hunch is if we allow agents to delegate exploration, the system will converge to the equilibriums where the agents are grouped
% by their issue area of interest and the agents who are responsible for exploration will arise. However, it's important to incorporate some constraints for delegation of exploration between agents to make the system more realistic.
% For example, in the real world, clients hire lobbyists because it's cheap and efficient to delegate information acquisition processes to lobbyists.
% Therefore, this paper should include the set of parameters that controls the \textit{discount factor} for the cost of exploration when the agent delegates its exploration to other agents. In addition, this paper also should include
% some rules for the agents to determine whether to keep delegating exploration to other agents or not. In the real world, it's quite common that clients terminate the contract with lobbyists when they think it's not worth it to keep hiring them.
% This kind of decision will be possible to incorporate by including another $\mathrm{Bernoulli}$ arm that represents the decision of the agent to keep delegating exploration to other agents or not.
% By doing so, this paper will be able to interpret the posterior distribution of those $\mathrm{Bernoulli}$ arms as the probability of the agent to keep delegating exploration to other agents. Therefore, this will prove or disprove the stable existence of lobbyists in the system.

\subsection{Purely Simulative Environment and Claim of the Paper}
In this paper, I focus on the varying equalibrium across the different hyperparmeters that deterimines the number of legislators, number of categories and discount factors for delegation.
% ratios of the number of legilsators to the number of clients.
If the number of legislstors are very small, the incentive of delegation is weak because the exchaustive exploration is possible.
However, if the number of legislators are sufficiently large, the incentive of delegation is strong because the exchaustive exploration is impossible
and benefits from the delegation become more significant. To explore the emergence of lobbyists within the framework of exploitation and exploration dillemma with regard to the size of the exploration space, this paper purely relies on the simulation without involving any empirical data. 
However, by observing the change of the equalibrium of the system with varying number of legilsators and issue areas, this paper aims to prove that lobbyists emerge when the number of legislators and number of issue categories are sufficiently large.



\section{Summary of the Proposal and Future Directions}
 
This paper aims to reproduce the emergence of lobbyists in a simulated environment.
To do so, it's required to implement $(1)$ categorized bandit \citep{NEURIPS2019_83462e22} and $(2)$ institutional feature that enables delegation.
After implementation, this paper will simulate the system and observe $(1)$ stability of the practice of delegation among agents and $(2)$ distributional characteristics of agents who keep delegated by other agents.
 
The biggest motivation to adopt this simulative approach is to prepare a computational environment that can model the different behavioral and institutional features that different theories of lobbying highlight.
% For example, \textit{persuasion} theories of lobbying are attacked under the empirical findings that people also lobby already like-minded legislators who don't need to be further persuaded.
% However, I suspect this is because of the dynamically changing authority of legislators over time.
% For the simplicity, this paper doesn't plan to model this dynamically changing authority of legislators over time.
Once this simulative environment is prepared, we can gradually build up and test the different theories of lobbying in this simulation environment.
Moreover, although this paper doesn't plan to involve any empirical data, this simulative environment can be equipped with the empirical data to more closely approximate the U.S. lobbying industry.
For example, we can use the actual bill sponsor information to model the varying authorities of legislators over different issue areas. Also, we can use the actual lobbying data to model the varying preferences of clients over different issue areas.
In conclusion, by preparing this computational environment, researchers will be able to test different theories on lobbying in a simulative environment. By doing so, this paper expects to facilitates agreement among scholars on answer to the question - "What is lobbying?".

% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.
% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.
% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.
% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}
% \section{Final instructions}
% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.
% \section{Preparing PDF files}
% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''
% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.
% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.
% \item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
%   acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
%   \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}
% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.
% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.
% \end{itemize}
% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.
% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}
% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})
% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.
% \section*{Broader Impact}
% Authors are required to include a statement of the broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.
% Authors should discuss both positive and negative outcomes, if any. For instance, authors should discuss a)
% who may benefit from this research, b) who may be put at disadvantage from this research, c) what are the consequences of failure of the system, and d) whether the task/method leverages
% biases in the data. If authors believe this is not applicable to them, authors can simply state this.
% Use unnumbered first level headings for this section, which should go at the end of the paper. {\bf Note that this section does not count towards the eight pages of content that are allowed.}
% \begin{ack}
% Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
% go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
% funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
% More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.
% Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
% \end{ack}
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
\bibliography{biblio}
% \section*{References}
% References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
% the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
% consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
% when listing the references.
% {\bf Note that the Reference section does not count towards the eight pages of content that are allowed.}

\section{Further Directions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Dirichlet distribution for arms (Need Boojum distribution, a conjugate prior of dirichlet distribution)
    \item Check this article for Boojum distribution \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05266}
\end{itemize}
