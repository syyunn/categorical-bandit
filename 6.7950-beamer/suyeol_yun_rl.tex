	\begin{frame}{Motivations}
		\fontsize{13pt}{12pt}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What is lobbying?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This question is simple but answered not clearly in the literature.
				% \begin{itemize}
				% 	\item Vote buying theory
				% 	\item Informational theory (provide information to legislators)
				% 	\item Counteractive lobbying (prevent legislators from being influenced by opposing lobbyists)
				% \end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Unexplained phenomenon in lobbying industry. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lobbyists usually lobby to both sides of legislators. (Why?)
				\begin{itemize}
					% \item (e.g.) Lobbyists \textit{campaign contribution} to both sides of legislators 
					\item in terms of their clients' interest.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Existing theories don't explain this phenomenon satisfactorily.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item If the lobbying is simply a process of buying vote, 
					then lobbyists should lobby to only one side of legislators.
				\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{New Theory of lobbying}
		\fontsize{13pt}{12pt}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item (Q. Why lobbyists lobby to both sides of legislators?)
			\item Lobbying is \textbf{delegated information acquisition} process.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Interest groups hiring lobbyist to acquire information about legislators' position on specific issue.
				\item Model this situation as a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Setting}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $|C| \in \mathbb{N}$ number of issue categories.
			\item $|J|$ number of interest groups
			\item Each interest groups $j \in J$ has their own unique category of interest $\phi(j)$
			% $\phi(j): J \rightarrow C$ which represents unique category of interest $\phi(j)$ for each interest group.
			\item $|K|$ number of legislators with $P_k$ reward distribution.
			\item Reward distribution $P_k$ is modeled as a \textbf{Categorical distribution} 
			with $|C|$ number of categories. 
			% $P_k$ is parameterized by $\mathbf{p_k} = [p_k^{(1)}, p_k^{(2)}, \hdots, p_k^{(C)}]$ where $p_k^{(i)} \in [0,1], \sum{p_k^{(i)}}=1$ with the support of $x_k \in \{1,2,\hdots,C\}$.  
			% (In other words, $X_k \sim \operatorname{Categorical}(\mathbf{p_k})$ where $X_k$ represents the category of authority of the $k$th legislator.)
			% (In other words, )
			\item Whenever an interest group $j$ interact with a legislator $k$, they receive $c \in \{1, 2, \hdots, C\}$ sampled from $P_k$.
			\item Each interst group $j$ gets reward of $r_j = \mathbbm{1}(x_k = \phi(j))$ when $j$ 
			choose legislator $k$ and sampled $x_k \in \{1, 2, \hdots, C\} $ from $P_k$. 
			\item To maximize the toal reward, interest groups need to find the 
			legislator who are most likely to sample their category of interest. 
			% \begin{itemize}
			% 	\item In other words, interest group $j$ with $\phi(j) = c$ gets reward of $1$ when they sample $c$ from interaction with legislator $k$.

	% 			\item Assume that there are $K$ possible choices (called ``arms'') for the agent to make. 
	% 			\item Each arm has a reward probability $P_k$ that is unknown to the agent.
	% 			\item Whenever the agent chooses an arm, it receives a reward $r_k$ with probability $P_k$.
	% 			\item The agent choose one of the arms for $T$ times and tries to maximize the total reward.
	% 			\item As the agent sequentially choose the arms, the agent builds his own estimate of the reward probability $P_k$ of each arm.
	% 			\item In this scenario, the agent keep facing the \textbf{exploration-exploitation} dilemma whether to choose the best rewarding arm based on his current estimates (so called ``exploitation'') or to try another arm to improve the current estimates because the current estimates can be biased (so called ``exploration'').

	\begin{frame}{Bandit Strategy}
		\fontsize{13pt}{12pt}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Used \textbf{Thompson Sampling} algorithm.
				\item Each interest group $j$ has their own prior belief over $|K|$ number of categorical distributions.
				\item Keep updating the prior belief using sampled observations from the interaction with legislators.
				% \item Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution.
				% \begin{itemize}
				% 	\item $f(\mathbf{p_k} | \mathcal{O}) \propto \mathcal{L(\mathcal{O | \mathbf{p_k}})} f(\mathbf{p_k})$ where $\mathbf{p_k} \sim \operatorname{Dirichlet(\mathbf{D_k})}$ with $\mathbf{D_k} = [d_k^{(1)}, d_k^{(2)}, \hdots, d_k^{(C)}] \in \mathbb{R}^C $ and $\mathcal{O}$ represents sampled observations from the interaction with legislators, i.e. $\mathcal{O} = [x_{j, t=1}^{k_1}, x_{j, t=2}^{k_2}, x_{j, t=3}^{k_3}, \hdots]$ where $x_{j, t}^{kt}$ is an observation sampled from the interaction with the legislator $k$ at time $t$. 
				% 	\item This is a $C$ dimensional generalization of the \textbf{Beta conjugate with Bernoulli likelihood}.
				% 	\item As we did in Beta conjugate, we can update the prior belief by simply adding $1$ to $d_c$ when observe $x_j = c \in C$ at each step $t \in T$.
				% 	% \item In this way of Bayesian update, interest groups can systematically update their prior belief over $\mathbf{p_k}$ based on obsevations from interactions with legislators.
				% \end{itemize}
				\item After update, choose the best rewarding legislator 
				based on the samples from posterior distributions. %to choose the next legislator to interact with.
				\item Use Dirichlet distribution for prior/posterior distribution because it is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution.

				%  Intuitively, the posterior distribution is the internal beleif of the interest group over the categorical distribution of legislator $k$

	% 		\item Let's check whether the Thompson Sampling algorithm can actually find the best rewarding legislator within the limited number of interactions.
	% 		% \item 32 legislators with 4 categories of interest. T=2000. (Total $32 \times 4 = 128$ number of parameters to search)
	% 		\item We use the metric called \textbf{Regret} to measure the performance of the algorithm for MAB problem. 
	% 		\item $\operatorname{Regret}_t^j \triangleq p_c^*-p_{a_t}^j$ where $c = \phi(j)$ and $p_c^* = \operatorname{argmax}_{k \in K}\{p_1^{(c)}, p_2^{(c)}, \hdots, p_K^{(c)}\} $ and $p_{a_t}^j$ is the $c$th parameter of $P_k$ when the agent choose the legislator $k$ at time $t$. $a_t$ represent the action (choice of legislator) taken by the agent at time $t$.
	% 		\item Regret represents how much the agent could have been done better in terms of the reward if it had chosen the best action.
	% 		\item Similarly, $\operatorname{Cumulative \text{ } Regret}_t^c \triangleq \sum_t^T p_c^*-p_{a_t}^j$.
